# Self-care check-in quiz

This interactive quiz was developed as a final project for the <i>Coding the News</i> (Spring 2025) class taught by <a href="http://github.com/rahulMuk/">Rahuldev Mukherjee</a> at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY. 

The quiz content was adapted from <a href="https://eponis.tumblr.com/post/113798088670/everything-is-awful-and-im-not-okay-questions-to" target="_blank">this questionnaire</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6A2F5ky9SELU0Zfd05YMEpyNUk/view?resourcekey=0-5vb6hV4tTpvuppnMw76vmg" target="_blank"><i>(PDF version available here)</i></a> and the execution was inspired by <a href="https://philome.la/jace_harr/you-feel-like-shit-an-interactive-self-care-guide/play/index.html">Philomeâ€™s self-care guide</a>.
