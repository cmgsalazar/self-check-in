If the weather's crap, drive to a big box store (e.g. Target) and go on a brisk walk through the aisles you normally skip. Remember that any movement counts!"

If you ever start feeling ineffective, pause and get something small completed, whether it's responding to an e-mail, loading up the dishwasher, or packing your gym bag for your next trip. Good job! Small wins build momentum and can help you feel more in control."

If a particular decision or problem is still being a roadblock, simply set it aside for now, and pick something else that seems doable. Right now, the important part is to break through that stasis, even if it means doing something trivial."
