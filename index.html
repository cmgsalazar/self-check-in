      <p>The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing its state counterpart’s community engagement with Melrose residents after they complained that it was stalling the cleanup of a vacant lot contaminated with hazardous chemicals. </p>

      <p>“Our team has reviewed the issues raised and we have met internally, and with DEC,” EPA Region 2 Administrator Lisa Garcia said, referring to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, in an email sent on Dec. 6 to the Melrose Environmental Awareness Committee (MEAC). </p>
        
      <p>MEAC, an organization of residents led by Angel Garcia, contends the DEC has been sitting on the cleanup of the lot and, despite community members’ repeated efforts, had not adequately engaged with them during the process. </p>
        
      <p>Residents are concerned about hazardous wastes found in the lot and possible adverse impacts on their health. </p>
        
      <p>For this reason, MEAC called on the federal agency in June to intervene. In November, EPA representatives toured the contaminated site at 753 Melrose Ave. and an eight-block impact area, which include a school, places of worship, residential buildings, and small businesses. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>The lot, formerly the site of a dry cleaner that closed in 1968, is listed as a Class 2 Superfund site, which means it “represents a significant threat to public health or the environment.” </p>

      <h2>Toxic wastes</h2>

      <p><a href="https://extapps.dec.ny.gov/data/DecDocs/203009/Fact Sheet.HW.203009.2016-08-30.Pre-RI_Factsheet_English.pdf" target="_blank">DEC records</a> show that tetrachloroethene, a chemical used in dry-cleaning, was found on the site at a level that exceeds the limit to prevent groundwater contamination. Also known as PCE, tetrachloroethene was also found in groundwater adjacent to the site at concentrations exceeding the standard. The contaminated lot is also next to the community Rainbow Garden, of which Angel Garcia is a board member. </p>

      <p>Exposure to the chemical and its byproducts are known to cause neurological problems, liver and kidney dysfunction, and some cancers, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/tetrachloroethylene.pdf" target="_blank">according to the EPA</a>. </p>

      <p>But DEC said in its <a href="https://extapps.dec.ny.gov/data/DecDocs/203009/Work Plan.HW.203009.2024-08-02.Enhanced Community Engagement Plan.pdf" target="_blank">latest work plan</a>, released in August, that there are “no observed or known exposures to this contamination.” </p>

      <p>“Groundwater at the site is not used as a public water supply,” the document said. “Additionally, prior SVI investigations indicate that soil vapor intrusion (which may impact indoor air quality) is not occurring.” </p>

      <h2>EPA’s role</h2>

      <p>Angel Garcia asked the EPA to be a public monitor of the project, a senior partner, or a potential litigator. “We don’t know if there’s a way to compel DEC,” he said. </p>

      <blockquote><p>If we were on Madison Avenue on the high-income Upper East Side of Manhattan instead of the low-moderate income Melrose Avenue of the South Bronx, a full-scale campaign would have been prepared and implemented, and already underway.</p>
      <p class="credit">— Angel Garcia, Melrose Environmental Awareness Committee </p></blockquote>

      <p>But Lisa Garcia, the regional administrator, said the EPA cannot take over the project. “Our job,” she said, “is going to be to talk to the state to figure out what has been happening since that assessment and if there’s any support that we can give.” </p> -->
