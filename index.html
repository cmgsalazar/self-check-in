        <h2>Hello, friend. </h2>

        <p>We get it. Life can sometimes feel overwhelming. You give so much of yourself to everything around you, and it’s easy to forget that you deserve care, too. </p>
        
        <p>This interactive quiz is intended to help people who may be struggling to reconnect with themselves. It is designed to take a little weight off your shoulders. Set aside some time to allow yourself to work through each step; do not rush or skip ahead. No one is keeping score of how fast or slow you go. </p>

        <p>But remember that this is not meant to replace professional and medical advice. Consider reaching out to friends, loved ones, and professionals for additional support. Even if you feel like life is going well for you, we hope you still find this a good resource. Let this be a safe space for you to treat yourself with care. We’ll sit with you. Or stand. Or lie down. </p>
        
        <p>You are worth caring for. </p>

      <h2>We’ve reached the end of this check-in. </h2>

      <p>Thank you for taking time to care for yourself today. Remember that self-care is neither a luxury or a reward; it’s a necessity. You deserve self-care, so even if it gets hard, try to make time for it. </p>

      <p>If you feel better now — great! And if you don’t, that’s OK, too. But we hope some of the steps we’ve taken have informed you of how to take good care of yourself. If you feel you’re still struggling, don’t hesitate to reach out to your friends, loved ones, or professionals. People want to show up for you — even if it doesn’t always feel that way. </p>

      <p>You’ve made it this far, and you will make it through. You are stronger than you think.</p>
